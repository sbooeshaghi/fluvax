With the announcement the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial data I was wondering how long potential vaccine distribution would be. I went and downloaded historical flu vaccine distribution data from the CDC (available [here](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-supply-historical.htm)) and examined the results.

An important note is that vaccine distribution data is not available for the 2019-2020 season. I called the CDC and reported this missing data. They were unable to locate it. I was told that they would "look into this" and that soneone would be "reaching out to me soon."

A basic analysis of the data can be found here:
