This repo attempts to bound the rate of vaccine distribution based on historical data of flu vaccine distribution. The data was collected from this the [CDC's website](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-supply-historical.htm). Note that vaccine distribution data is not available for the 2019-2020 season. I called the CDC and reported this missing data. They were unable to locate it either. I was told that they would "look into this" and that soneone would be "reaching out to me soon."

A basic analysis of the data can be found here:
